Rerun nbs except grandmesa for new repo structure
Change backscatter plots to dB
Sentinel-2, use box instead of point for searching scenes so we have full images at each timestamp
For ripening function, add option for 2-3dB threshold drop
.melt_onset_elevation_line() levation-meltday curve for each year and each mountain
.aggregate_by_doy()
.plot_gif()
Add Mt. Shasta, others? Glacier Peak, etc
predict runoff with NDSI (correlate melt with landsat and calculate snowmelt timing for historical landsat catalog)
break out strength of MLS corrs by year
stream gauge data (look at martha creek riverbed, NEON-national ecological observation network)
SNOTEL temperatures
given geojson,give correct MGRS tile
clean up env
trim down demonstration notebook
make sure demonstration notebooks are calculating runoff map correctly--which time domain to use
